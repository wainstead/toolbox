First, make a screenshot of the Quartiles game. Rename it so there's
no spaces in the file name (it will be "Screen shot somedate sometime
.ext" or somesuch). Then put the path to that file into the script
below. With Copilot I'd make it rewrite the script to take a command
line argument for the file.


$ export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH # for both python3 from Homebrew, and the 'tesseract' binary

So that works... next Gemini proposes a brute force approach to
finding the quartiles:


import itertools

def is_valid_word(word):
    # Implement your word validity check here
    # You can use a dictionary or a language model
    return word in your_word_list

def find_quartiles(words):
    for combination in itertools.combinations(words, 4):
        remaining_words = [word for word in words if word not in combination]
        for second_combination in itertools.combinations(remaining_words, 4):
            # ... and so on, for the remaining 3 combinations

            # Check if all 5 combinations are valid words
            if all(is_valid_word(group) for group in [combination, second_combination, ...]):
                print(combination, second_combination, ...)

# Example usage:
words = ['beh', 'rus', 'the', 'less', 'ce', 'nds', 'go', 'er', 'rifr', 'av', 'sau', 'ste', 'nev']
find_quartiles(words)
