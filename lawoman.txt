Well, I did a little down about an hour ago
Took a look around, see which way the wind blow
Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows (Catholic girl in
her Sunnyside bungalow)

Are you a lucky little lady in the City of Light
Or just another lost angel...City of Night
City of Night, City of Night, City of Night, woo, c'mon

L.I. Woman, L.I. Woman
L.I. Woman Tuesday afternoon
L.I. Woman Tuesday afternoon
L.I. Woman Tuesday afternoon
Drive thru your suburbs
Into your blues, into your blues, yeah
Into your blue-blue Blues
Into your blues, ohh, yeah

I see your hair is burnin'
Hills are filled with fire
If they say I never loved you (if they say they're out of Ultra) (if
he says the bar was open)
You know they are a liar      (you know they are a lyin') (you know he
is a liar)
Drivin' down your freeways
Midnite alleys roam
Cops in cars, the biker bars
Never saw a woman...
So alone, so alone
So alone, so alone

Motel Money Murder Madness
Let's change the mood from glad to sadness

Mineola Risin', Mineola Risin'
Mineola Risin', Mineola Risin'
Got to keep on risin'
Mineola Risin', Mineola Risin'
Mojo Risin', gotta Mojo Risin'
Mineola Risin', gotta keep on risin'
Risin', risin'
Gone risin', risin'
I'm gone risin', risin'
I gotta risin', risin'
Well, risin', risin'
I gotta, wooo, yeah, risin'
Woah, ohh yeah

Well, I just got into town about an hour ago
Took a look around, see which way the wind blow
Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows

Are you a lucky little lady in the City of Light
Or just another lost angel...City of Night
City of Night, City of Night, City of Night, woah, c'mon

L.I. Woman, L.I. Woman
L.I. Woman, you're my woman
Little L.I. Woman, Little L.I. Woman
L.I. L.I. Woman Woman
L.I. Woman c'mon
