* customers set prices on their stuff. see entry 090430

* tinyurl project: see entry for 090511
* also internal tinyurl project (much smaller scale)
* photrade
* candy box
* unified "Shop" for mpa+dotphoto
* unify product classes:
   "I already fleshed out, on paper, GallerySiteHelper and
   GiftsSiteHelper classes to abstract away differences like
   'getThumbnailURL()'." (in the Cart; this idea has merit).

* unified cart for mpa+dotphoto
  * isolate "the file and its location" from the Cart
* dotphoto importer to mpa
* get www and static under tag/release
  * redo tagrelease. throw out gnu changelog crap.
  * redo rollout script; use branches and not tags.
  * reliable way to flush caches (varnish and apc)
  * see 090513
* deleting sites: change their status only. clean up later. Let
  Veracity do it.
* shipping project is in Trac and is tasked to Fernando

* Next iteration of MPP, unless Tim does it; unlikely though.
* Purge all old products and all old orders that contain them.
* batch uploading of MPA photos to Facebook
* create mpa account from gmc flow
* cd/dvd project (Fernando?)
* separate print quantity/size selection from the cart itself


system/programming/plumbing to-dos:
* redo all service outages from scratch
* optimize GMC's image creation (don't make sized until asked; don't
  copy the full sized image)
* change $GALLERY_BASEDIR and brethren to constants
* rid Gallery of global emulation of form vars. See 09010
* complete www's testlogin.php, which tries to log you into your
  Gallery from another site like www.
* consolidate the rest of tree's code
* GMC now depends on Gallery code. Fix this.
* create table documenting the other tables in the mpa database
* Bring iPhoto plugin up to date; learn how to compile and package it
* idea: (Incidentally, my current thinking is to put off Veracity, and
  code Gallery to do all the work of storing the data in the database,
  and copying over stuff only when there's a hit on the site. Then,
  with this 'dual mode Gallery' we have time to port the data into the
  DB).
